# MVSE

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

MVSE, Mosquito-borne Viral Suitability Estimator, provides methods for the estimation of an index of climate-based transmission potential for mosquito-borne viruses. It can be parametrized for any combination of host, virus and mosquito-species of interest with local climate data. 

## Installation

The MVSE package is currently not hosted on CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network). We thus need to install the package directly from the GithHub repo where it is hosted. 

```{r}
install.packages("devtools")
require(devtools)
install_github()
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(MVSE)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
